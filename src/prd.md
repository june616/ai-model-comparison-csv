# Model Comparison Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Enable systematic evaluation of AI model responses by distributing different question sets across evaluators to ensure comprehensive assessment coverage.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Clear differentiation between assigned question sets per evaluator
- Complete evaluations for all assigned questions
- Persistent data storage for analysis
- Intuitive evaluation workflow

**Experience Qualities**: Organized, focused, professional

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with structured state management)

**Primary User Activity**: Acting and evaluating - users interact with assigned question sets to provide structured feedback

## Core Problem Analysis

**Problem**: AI model comparison requires systematic evaluation across multiple criteria, but evaluating all questions by all users creates redundancy and evaluator fatigue. Different evaluators need different question assignments for efficient coverage.

**User Context**: Evaluators need to see only their assigned questions, understand what topics they're responsible for, and complete structured assessments efficiently.

**Critical Path**: User selection → View assigned questions → Complete evaluations → Submit results

**Key Moments**: 
1. User sees their specific question assignment clearly
2. Smooth navigation through assigned questions only
3. Successful submission with confirmation

## Essential Features

### Question Assignment System
**Functionality**: Each user has a predefined set of questions assigned to them
**Purpose**: Distribute evaluation workload and ensure comprehensive coverage without redundancy
**Success Criteria**: Users only see and evaluate their assigned questions

### User Selection with Assignment Preview
**Functionality**: Home page shows each user with their assigned question topics
**Purpose**: Clear communication of responsibilities before starting evaluation
**Success Criteria**: Users understand their assignment before beginning

### Structured Evaluation Interface
**Functionality**: Multi-criteria rating system with knowledge level assessment
**Purpose**: Capture standardized feedback for model comparison
**Success Criteria**: Complete ratings and feedback for all assigned questions

### Data Persistence
**Functionality**: All evaluations saved and retrievable with admin access for results viewing
**Purpose**: Enable analysis, prevent data loss, and provide administrative oversight
**Success Criteria**: Submitted evaluations persist across sessions and can be exported by administrators

### Administrative Results Access
**Functionality**: Admin interface to view all evaluation results and export data
**Purpose**: Enable data analysis, reporting, and result compilation
**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive results viewing with CSV/JSON export capabilities

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and systematic organization
**Design Personality**: Clean, systematic, trustworthy
**Visual Metaphors**: Evaluation forms, comparison grids, progress tracking
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes clarity and focus

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep purple (oklch(42.4% 0.199 265.638)) - conveys professionalism and focus
**Secondary Colors**: Light purple tints for structure and hierarchy
**Accent Color**: Bright purple for interactive elements and progress indication
**Color Psychology**: Purple suggests careful analysis and methodical approach
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: High contrast text on light backgrounds for readability

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single clean sans-serif for consistency and clarity
**Primary Font**: Inter - excellent for data-heavy interfaces and forms
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size relationships between headings, body text, and metadata
**Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing and comfortable reading sizes
**Which fonts**: Inter for all text elements

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Question topics prominently displayed, clear progress indicators
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing around form elements and cards
**Grid System**: Centered layouts with consistent padding and margins
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-friendly evaluation interface
**Content Density**: Balanced information presentation without overwhelming

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for question presentation and user selection
- Badges for topic identification and status display
- Progress indicators for evaluation status
- Radio buttons for rating scales
- Buttons for navigation and actions
- Data tables for admin results viewing
- Download buttons for data export

**Accessibility & Readability**: WCAG AA compliance for all interactive elements

## Implementation Considerations

### Question Assignment Logic
- Each user assigned 1-3 questions from available pool
- Assignment distribution ensures each question evaluated by multiple users
- Clear topic labeling for easy identification

### State Management
- User selection triggers loading of assigned questions only
- Progress tracking per question and overall
- Clean state reset between user sessions

### Data Structure
- User profiles include assigned question IDs
- Questions filtered based on user assignment
- Evaluation results linked to specific user and question sets
- Admin access to aggregate results across all users
- Export functionality for data analysis and reporting

## Reflection

This approach ensures systematic evaluation coverage while preventing evaluator fatigue. The assignment system allows for efficient data collection across multiple question topics while maintaining clear user focus on their specific responsibilities.
